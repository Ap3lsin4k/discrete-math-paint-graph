 data structures:
 
 nodes = `[Vertex('a'), Vertex('b')]`
 
edge is `(from, to: Vertex)`

 edge_list

colors is array of Colour [Red(), Blue(), Green(), Orange()]

 class Red(Color)

 Vertex has Color

 Vertex has ID name number

 constraints:

- easily get all neighborhood and second neighborhood to a vertex
- easily
